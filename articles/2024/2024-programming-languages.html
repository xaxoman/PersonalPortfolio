                    There are a lot of programming languages out there and it can be tough to 
                    choose which one you should dedicate your time to.
                    In this article, I'm going to show you which one you should pick from the 
                    perspective of a computer science student.
                </p>

                <div class="general-paragraph">
                    <h1>Why should you study a programming language?</h1>
            
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Job opportunities:</strong> In today's day and age, knowing at least one programming language can help you find more job opportunities regardless of your aspirations, whether you want to be a data analyst, a web developer, or work in finance, marketing, etc...</li>

                        <li><strong>Smart working:</strong> Working from the comfort of your home is a reality for many programmers who are fortunate enough to do so. Since programmers only require their computers for work, they don't have to worry about going to the office. They can work from home and manage their work schedule with more flexibility.</li>

                        <li><strong>You can work abroad:</strong> Programming allows you to work wherever you want. You can fly to another country and still work perfectly. The only thing needed is a laptop and an internet connection.</li>

                        <li><strong>Build your own business:</strong> Learning a new programming language can be beneficial if you are looking to start your own business, or if you already have one and want to improve it. With programming knowledge, you can create your own website, collect data from your clients, and perform other essential tasks that can help your business grow and succeed.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
    
                <div class="general-paragraph">
                    <h2>Which programming language should I study?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It all depends on what your goal is. For example, if you want to be a web developer 
                        you need to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but if your goal is to become a data 
                        analyst then it's preferred to learn languages like Python, SQL, and R lang. 
                        Find why you want to learn how to program in the first place, then investigate 
                        which programming language is most commonly used in your field.

                <div class="general-paragraph">
                    <h2>Where do I start learning once I pick one?</h2>
                    <p>There are a lot of places to start learning, for example:</p>

                <div class="general-paragraph">
                    <h2>Isn't AI going to replace programmers?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It's important to understand that while AI is an excellent tool for programmers, 
                        it cannot fully replace them. However, it can drastically enhance their productivity 
                        and speed, making their work more efficient and effective.

                <div class="general-paragraph">
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, learning a programming language can open up a world of opportunities 
                        for you and your career. Whether you want to work in tech, build your own business, 
                        or just have a valuable skill, programming is a great option. It's important to choose 
                        the right programming language based on your goals and aspirations, and then find the
                        best resources to start learning. With hard work, dedication, and the right tools, 
                        you can become a skilled programmer and take advantage of all the benefits that come with it.
